Implemented an Employee Management System in Java. The system calculates the gross salary of employees based on their roles, incorporating principles of object-oriented programming.

Key Achievements: Designed a class hierarchy with a superclass (Employee) and subclasses (Manager and Clerk) to model different employee types. Implemented encapsulation by hiding attributes (Employee No, Employee Name, Basic Salary) with appropriate getter methods. Utilized constructors for initializing attributes, demonstrating proficiency in object instantiation. Developed methods (calBonus, calGrossSalary, and calTax) to calculate bonuses, gross salary, and taxes, showcasing problem-solving skills. Overrode methods in the Manager class to customize bonus and gross salary calculations, demonstrating polymorphism.

Technologies Used: Java, IntelliJ IDEA

Sample Output: For the provided employee data, the system accurately generates gross salary calculations for various employee types, adhering to company policies.
